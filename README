This is a fork of adba to leverage the existing UDP API code  for new features
at inception there are 3 forks we wish to pursue


1) a caching system for hashes such that unless the file has changed a rehash is uneccessary 
2) session settings for anidb such to minimize requests along with caching of anidb responses
3) a cli utility for pulling arbitrary information from anidb or adding/marking files in anidb
4) a renaming script that will hash incoming files, add to anidb and then apply user configurable renaming rules




Original Readme from lad1337
this is a simple to use anidb interface
it is based on libpyanidb by alexer !
more info on his great work can be found here : http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_Clients#libpyanidb
thank you alexer !



to start using the module have a look at test.py
test.py can be called in the command line

e.g. python test.py -u user -p password -f path/to/some/strangeFile.avi
for further information have a look into test.py
